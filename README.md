OSL Draft app

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE APP

The application gives a set timer for each team, the next team is shown, and the last picked is shown. 
Once the timer runs out, or you press E the second screen will appear with buttons that have letters.
The letters will take you to an alphabetical list of players in that section of the alphabet.
There is a back key on the bottom left to go to the alphabet again.
After the draft there will be an excel sheet on your desktop named DraftResults that has a list of teams and the players they picked.


Keys, 
D = Show the Draft
E = Pick for the current team
P = Pause the timer
Backspace = Undue the last pick (you can only do this once in a row)
K = End the Draft (Dont press this)
Escape = Exit the Application
